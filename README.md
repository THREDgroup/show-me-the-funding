# Show me the funding!
This is a tool to help look up funding statistics for NSF programs. In some cases that is useful for proposal preparation, as you can verify that your budget is not significantly outside of the funding profile for the program. However, when in doubt, you should always talk to the program officer.

Finally, although this project uses NSF's API, it is not support, condoned, or endorsed by the National Science Foundation.
